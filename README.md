# Object Localisation üì¶üîé
A Computer Vision project (LOK_1) to mark objects with a bounding box as close-fitting as possible. 

## Setup Guide üõ†Ô∏è
### Setup local dev environment on Linux/Mac:

After you've successfully setup this project as your template repository, check if python is 
available `python3 --version` and `python3 -m pip --version`.
Both statements should return a version number!

Set up a python environment to install all necessary packages locally. In case you don't have virtualenv yet, type `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`. 
For this you can type `python3 -m venv venv`. 
You activate the environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.

Now you can install all necessary libraries with `pip install -r 
requirements.txt`.

### Setup local dev environment on Windows:

After you've successfully setup this project as your template repository, check if python is 
available `py --version` and `py -m pip --version`.
Both statements should return a version number!

Set up a python environment to install all necessary packages locally. In case you don't have virtualenv yet, type `py -m pip install --user virtualenv`.
For this you can type `py -m venv env`. 
You activate the environment with `.\env\Scripts\activate`.

Now you can install all necessary libraries with `pip install -r 
requirements.txt`.
